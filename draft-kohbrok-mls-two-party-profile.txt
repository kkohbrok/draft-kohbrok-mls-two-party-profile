1.  Introduction

   MLS is primarily designed to be a continuous group key agreement (and
   messaging) protocol.  This document explores the special case of
   groups of two and thus MLS's use as a (non-group) continuous key
   agreement protocol with a focus on the use in synchronous scenarios.

   The two-party profile of MLS described in this document can, for
   example, be used as a replacement for other key exchange protocols
   that don't provide post-compromise security and/or post-quantum
   security.  This is the case with the key exchange components for many
   secure channel protocols today.

   TODO: For now, this document specifies a simple two party profile
   based on vanilla MLS that assumes synchronous communication.  In the
   future, we should explore the asynchronous case and add a more
   specialized version that trims unnecessary things like signatures in
   key update messages, etc.

2.  Protocol overview

   The synchronous case assumes that both parties are online.  The party
   sending the first message is the initiator and the other party the
   responder.  The protocol can be split into three phases.

   1.  Initial key agreement

   2.  Continuous key agreement

   3.  Resumption

   In Phase 1, the initiator and responder exchange messages until they
   agree on a shared key and thus enter Phase 2.

   In Phase 2, both parties can perform key-updates to achieve forward-
   secrecy (FS) and post-compromise security (PCS).  To avoid de-
   synchronization, both parties have to await confirmation of each
   update by the other party before they can perform another one.  This
   phase continues until the connection between the parties is
   interrupted.

   Phase 3 allows either party to resume the connection.  During
   resumption, initiator and responder exchange messages to renew their
   key material before they (re-)enter Phase 2.

   While the synchronous two-party case is significantly simpler when it
   comes to the responsibilities of the MLS Delivery Service, it still
   requires both parties to interface with an Authentication Service to
   validate both initial credentials and any credential updates.

3.  Initial key agreement

   struct {
     MLSMessage key_package;
   } ClientHello

   struct {
     MLSMessage welcome;
   } ServerHello

   The initiator starts the key agreement part of the protocol by
   creating a KeyPackage and sending a ClientHello to the responder.

   The responder inspects the KeyPackage and checks whether it supports
   the offered ciphersuite and whether the initiator has sufficient
   capabilities to support the connection.

   The responder MUST interface with the AS to ensure that the
   credential in the KeyPackage is valid.

   The responder then locally creates an MLS group and commits to an Add
   proposal containing the initiator's KeyPackage.  The responder sends
   the resulting Welcome message back to the initiator as part of a
   ServerHello message.

   The initiator uses the Welcome to create its local group state.  The
   initiator then inspects the group state and MUST interface with the
   AS to ensure that the credential of the responder is valid.

4.  Continuous key agreement

   struct {
     MLSMessage update
   } ConnectionUpdate

   struct {
     uint64 epoch;
   } EpochKeyUpdate

   After the initial key agreement phase, both parties can send an MLS
   commit with UpdatePath to update their key material.  To ensure that
   both agree on the order of such commits and thus on the currently
   used key material, they must follow the following rules.

   *  Each party may send a ConnectionUpdate if they are not currently
      waiting for an EpochKeyUpdate to confirm a previous
      ConnectionUpdate

   *  If either party receives a ConnectionUpdate and they're not
      currently waiting for an EpochKeyUpdate, they MUST validate and
      apply the commit and respond with an EpochKeyUpdate, where epoch
      is the group's new epoch

   *  If the initiator receives a ConnectionUpdate while waiting for an
      EpochKeyUpdate, it MUST ignore the ConnectionUpdate and resume
      waiting

   *  If the responder receives a ConnectionUpdate while waiting for an
      EpochKeyUpdate, it MUST drop its locally pending commit and
      validate and apply the commit as if it hadn't been waiting for an
      EpochKeyUpdate

   *  A party receiving a ConnectionUpdate MUST start using the key
      material of the new epoch after sending the EpochKeyUpdate

   *  A party sending a ConnectionUpdate MUST wait until they receive
      the corresponding EpochKeyUpdate before they start using the key
      material of the new epoch

5.  Resumption

   Either party may resume a previously interrupted protocol session
   based on that session's group state.  The party initiating the
   resumption becomes the initiator.

   struct {
     MLSMessage commit;
   } ResumptionRequest

   struct {
     MLSMessage commit;
   } ResumptionResponse

   The initiator sends a Resumption message to the responder.  If the
   initiator was waiting for an EpochKeyUpdate while the connection was
   interrupted, it MUST include the commit from the last
   ConnectionUpdate in the Resumption message.  The initiator MUST then
   wait for a ResumptionResponse.

   The responder receiving a ResumptionRequest MUST validate and apply
   the commit in the ResumptionRequest and create a commit with
   UpdatPath to send back as part of a ResumptionResponse.

   If one of the parties receives a ResumptionRequest while waiting for
   a ResumptionResponse, their reaction depends whether they were the
   initial initiator or responder when the connection was first
   established.  The initial initiator MUST drop the ResumptionRequest
   and continue waiting.  The initial responder MUST drop its pending
   commit and instead validate and apply the incoming commit before
   responding with a fresh commit as part of a ResumptionResponse.
